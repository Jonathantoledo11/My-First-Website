      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a 23 year old tech nerd based out of the Pacific NorthWest. I have mostly only ever worked blue collar jobs my whole life but have always had a love for tech. Last year during covid I was thinking to myself what I wanted to do with my future and if I would really be content with working in a warehouse until i'm sixty. So I decided well the world is already falling apart might as well take a chance and pursue a career in a field that I have always wanted to be in all my life. So here I am now trying to make this a reality and ready to put my all in to this.</p>
